Supso is a digital suite that helps you create measurable digital products. It's an honest and transparent app (source code). We want to empower indie builders and product companies.

## Why you may want to use Supso

Supso helps to unify and process the data you can collect from your product and different tools you use additionally.

### Some use cases

- Use events tracked with Supso in Zapier Zaps (RSS Feed).
- Track app events and send the important events to Discord (Webhooks).
- Track crashlytics of your app and create a triage (Kanban Boards).
- Set up a micro CRM and track onboardings of your business customers (Kanban with columns like `client_onboarded`, `client_reached_out`, `successful_lead`).
- View metrics and track growth.

## Core concepts

The core concepts of Supso.

### Event

Event represents a single piece of information about your product. A thing that happened which you may want to take into consideration while making the next decision. We allow to query and organize events easily with views as Events and Boards.

### Project

Projects help to organize events, boards, and feature toggles. Project can be run by whole team or just by you. Invite members to projects and adjust their permissions.

### Boards

We implemented boards, because we enjoyed working with Kanban on software engineering projects. Now we translated them to product observability, so you can better manage your business.

### Feature Flag

Manage the features that are embedded into your apps and toggle them as needed. Imagine you got a third party provider outage that makes part of your trigger a crash of your app. If it's wrapped into a feature flag you can temporarily disable this feature to prevent that.
